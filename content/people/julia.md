Julia is the Queen of Software Development at Wireless Registry building microservices and Web UIs with Go and JavaScript. She has been hacking web development since she was a kid and hasn't stopped. When she isn't writting software she is at the barn hanging out with her horse [Samwise ðŸ’–](http://samwise.horse).
